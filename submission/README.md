## Using this project's code
### Dependencies
Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. We recommend starting by installing CUDA-enabled torchvision (instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)) -- then, matplotlib, scipy, and requests should be the only real requirements.
### Running the code
To obtain our experiment's results, simply run the cells of `resnet_AM.ipynb` in order. Details on what each function does are commented.
